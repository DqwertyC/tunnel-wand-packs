# Tunnel Wand
This datapack and resourcepack adds a tunneling wand to Minecraft.

### IMPORTANT NOTE: 

This datapack adds extra dimensions to save the broken blocks. Because of this, it's best if the datapack is added at world creation.

Because of the way the Trim system works, both the datapack *and* resource pack are required.  
If the recipe isn't working, try `/reload` and `F3+t`. After that, the world may still need to be exited and re-entered for recipes to start working properly

### OVERVIEW:

Create the tunneling wand in a smithing table using a nether_star, a blaze rod, and an eye of ender:

To use the wand, place it in your offhand. With the wand equipped, blocks broken with your mainhand are no longer dropped. Instead, they phase into another dimension:

After a few seconds, the broken blocks will repair themselves:

Currently, the wand doesn't work on multi-part blocks (such as beds and doors), or on some transparent blocks like crops and flowers.
